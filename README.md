#This research presents a neural network - centered system aiming to forecast match data for El Clásico, which is the long - standing and momentous rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. By making use of historical data such as the number of goals, yellow cards, red cards, match types, and dates spanning from 1985 to 2025, the project undertakes data preprocessing. This preprocessing involves techniques like one - hot encoding, rolling statistics calculation, and data standardization. And the predictive model is developed with TensorFlow and Keras. It adopts a sequential neural network structure that is composed of several dense layers and incorporates dropout regularization. For the training and evaluation of the model, 80% of the data is utilized for training purposes, while 20% is used for testing. Early stopping and model checkpointing strategies are also implemented during this process. And the experimental findings indicate that the model has the ability to predict various outcomes, including the number of goals and disciplinary actions, with different levels of confidence. Although the system exhibits encouraging accuracy, the paper also points out its drawbacks. It further suggests that adding more real - world features could be beneficial to improve the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
